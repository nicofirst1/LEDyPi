Follow the instructions on the [Installation guide](../markdowns/INSTALL.md) to see how to start your android app.

## Dynamic settings (Update)
Now you don't need to implement any additional component into the android app anymore. The views are completely dynamic 
to show all the additional parameters of your settings without coding.

Just import the [app](ledypi.aia) into the [MitInventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) screen and add your Firebase token and URL.

That's it!
