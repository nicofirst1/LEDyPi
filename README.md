# Key Features
Choose from more than 10 pre-made patterns and implement your own.
The modular desing allows you to add the logic you wish by overriding a single method, then you can choose the pattern either trough ssh or on the android app.

- 14 pre-made patterns
- Customizable attributes for each one
- [Music reactive](#music-reactive-click-gif-for-video) 
- [Android app](AppInventor) for control 
- [LedyWeb](https://github.com/nicofirst1/ledyweb) online controller 
- Firebase database
- Debug mode available 

# Patterns
Each pattern inherits from a [base class](src/patterns/default.py) with its own logic. This allows anyone to implement his own pattern simply by overriding a method (see more on the [readme](patterns/README.md)).

Moreover each pattern can be customized by changing the values of its attributes, more ahead.

## Fixed logic
There are more than 10 _standard_ pattern to choose from with a steady logic, that is a fixed behavior.

<h3 >Water</h3>

Bring the ocean home with the ocean pattern. You can choose the deepness with the parameters

![water demo](Resources/water_demo.gif)

<h3 >Fire</h3>

If you're cold then try the fire pattern.

<h3 >Game of Life</h3>

Watch how life evolves with the famous [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) algorithm.

## Interactive
On top of these fixed patters there are two interactive patters whose behavior can completely change based on the user input"

### Music Reactive (click gif for video)
[![audio demo](Resources/audio_demo2.gif)](https://youtu.be/7PXDBr3uZmA) 

This pattern uses a microphone to visualize the music on your led strip. There are three different type of visualization:
- Spectrum: split the strip on subsequent frequency bands and visualize the amplitude as a mix of rgb values
- Energy: use an energy function to plot the sound on the leds
- Scroll: record the audio amplitude on a scrolling timeline.

### Equation
You can input a custom equation for the rgb values. Such equation can depend on:
- time: a time-step is kept so to evolve the function through time
- index: the position of the led-strip can also be used

For example the following patters is given with:
- red = _cos(t)_
- green = _sin(t)_
- blue = _idx_

### Image
Designing a pattern can become hard and take some time, so why not using a pre-made pattern?

With _Image_ you can use an URL pointing to an image and LedyPi will download it and display it for you.

# Installation 
For the installation check out the related [INSTALL file](markdowns/INSTALL.md).

# Running 
Once you have installed the project on the RaspberryPi you can start it with the [start script](scripts):
```shell script
bash ledypi/scripts/app.sh start
```

For the web controller run it with ( more options are available in the ledyweb [README](ledyweb/README.md)):
```shell script
python manage.py start
```

For testing see the [USAGE file](markdowns/USAGE.md)

# Contributing
If you wish to support this project just fork it and add your pattern following the [readme](src/patterns/README.md).
