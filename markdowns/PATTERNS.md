Each pattern has multiple modifiers which can drastically change its appearance. 

The following videos are taken with the default values.

### Equation
You can input a custom equation for the rgb values. Such equation can depend on:
- time: a time-step is kept so to evolve the function through time
- index: the position of the led-strip can also be used

For example the following patters is given with:
- red = _cos(t)_
- green = _sin(t)_
- blue = _idx_

### Music Reactive (click gif for video)
[![audio demo](../Resources/patterns/audio_demo.gif)](https://youtu.be/7PXDBr3uZmA) 

This pattern uses a microphone to visualize the music on your led strip. There are three different type of visualization:
- Spectrum: split the strip on subsequent frequency bands and visualize the amplitude as a mix of rgb values
- Energy: use an energy function to plot the sound on the leds
- Scroll: record the audio amplitude on a scrolling timeline.


### Image
Designing a pattern can become hard and take some time, so why not using a pre-made pattern?

With _Image_ you can use an URL pointing to an image and LedyPi will download it and display it for you.
